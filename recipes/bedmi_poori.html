        <li>red chilli powder as required</li>
        <li>2 cup refined oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Soak urad dal overnight and make a coarse paste:</em><p>Start with washing and soaking the Urad Dal for about 6 to 8 hours. Now, the dal needs to be blended. So, drain the water and add the dal in a blender with ginger and green chillies and blend until a thick paste is obtained. You can add a little water if required. But the paste should not be runny.</p></li>
        <li><em>Knead the dough:</em><p>To prepare the dough, add whole wheat flour to a bowl and add the dal paste into it. Now add Â¼ cup oil, fennel powder, coriander powder, salt, amchoor powder, hing and red chilli powder. You can add 1 tsp crushed kasoori methi if you want, but this is optional. Mix everything well and knead a tight dough.</p></li>
        <li><em>Make dough balls and prepare the poori:</em><p>Let the dough rest for at least 10 minutes and then start making dough balls out of it for pooris. Meanwhile, heat some oil in a kadhai. Then use a rolling pin to roll the pooris.</p></li>
        <li><em>Fry the Bedmi Pooris and serve:</em><p>Now deep fry them one by one in hot oil. Once they turn golden brown from both sides, take out from the kadhai and put on a paper towel for the oil to drain out a bit. Serve hot with a delicious Aloo ki Subzee.</p></li>
