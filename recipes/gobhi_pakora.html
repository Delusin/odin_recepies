    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 green chilli</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 cup mustard oil</li>
        <li>1 small cauliflower</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>

        <li>2 tablespoon coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Prepare the batter:</em><p>Take besan in a bowl. Add salt, red chilli powder, chopped green chilli, ginger paste, garlic paste and coriander leaves. Now add water in batches and mix well to prepare a lump-free batter. The batter should be neither too thin nor too thick.</p></li>
        <li><em>Heat the oil:</em><p>Pour the mustard oil in a kadhai and keep on medium-high flame. Let it heat until smoke emerges from it. Make sure you heat mustard oil well to get rid of its smell.</p></li>
        <li><em>Chop the cauliflower:</em><p>Now wash the cauliflower properly and pat it dry. Chop the florets and collect them in a bowl.</p></li>
        <li><em>Fry the pakoras:</em><p>Now dip one floret into the batter and drop in hot oil. Repeat this step and fry all the gobhi florets in batches until golden brown from outside.</p></li>
        <li><em>Ready to be served:</em><p>Once fried, your Gobhi Pakora are now ready to be served. Pair up with dip of your choice and enjoy.</p></li>
