Since ages, indulging in snacks for breakfast and evening tea has been a part of their rich culinary heritage. This amazingly delicious recipe may look complicated, but it is actually very easy to make at home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for <em>4</em> servings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 green chilli</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>3 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>2 onion</li>
        <li>refined oil as required</li>
        <li>2 pinches powdered turmeric</li>
        <li>2 boiled potato</li>
        <li>1 handful coriander leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Wash the veggies and boil the potatoes:</em><p>To begin with this easy recipe, just wash the veggies, peel the potatoes and onions. Then take a vessel, add some water and boil the potatoes. Once boiled drain the water and mash them nicely. In the meantime, chop the onion, coriander leaves and mix them with the mashed potatoes along with 2 teaspoon red chillies, cumin powder, a pinch of turmeric and salt as per taste. Your stuffing is ready, keep it aside until needed.</p></li>
        <li><em>Slit the chillies and add the stuffing:</em><p>Next, take a knife and make slits from the centre of green chillies and scrape out the chill seeds. Then stuff in the filling and repeat the same process with rest of the chillies.</p></li>
        <li><em>Make the batter:</em><p>Take a large bowl, add besan along with a teaspoon of chilli, salt, a pinch of turmeric, one teaspoon oil and little water. Mix them together into a lump-free batter. Make sure the batter is not too thin or to thick.</p></li>
        <li><em>Deep fry and relish!:</em><p>Dip the stuffed chillies in the batter till they are completely covered. In the meantime, heat a kadhai over medium flame and add some oil, once the oil is hot, slowly drop the batter-dipped chillies in the oil and deep fry them, till they turn golden in colour. Serve hot with chutney or sauces, and relish it with a piping hot cup of masala chai.</p></li>
